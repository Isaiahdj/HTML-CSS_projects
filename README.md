# HTML-CSS_projects

This repository will hold all my HTML and CSS project from my Tech Academy course. I will be making web pages starting with hello world going all the way up to a portfolio site, where I can showcase all my various projects I have worked on. I hope you enjoy!

## [HTML Project 1](./Html_P1)

In this project I learned the basic structure of HTML documents. I also learned how to connect multiple HTML documents using `<a>` links and a `<nav>` bar. In my [Dog_Video.html](./Html_P1/HTML/Dog_Video.html) I used an embeded video.

## [HTML Project 2](./Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1)

In this project I learned how to uses `<font>` tag in HTML, as well as some of its different attributes like face, size and color. `<font color = "" face = "" size = "">`
I also learned some basic [JavaScript](./Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1/Basic_Javascript_1.js) like how to make a function that changed the text color to green when a user pushes a button, or how to make alert pop up. in adition to all of that I learned how to utilize the tags `<b>`(makes things bold), `<i>`(italisizes), and `<u>`(underlines).

## [HTML and CSS](./Basic_HTML_and_CSS)

In this project I learned how to use the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). I Learned How to link my CSS to my HTML page to add style to it. I also learned the diference between the two [HTML Lists](./Basic_HTML_and_CSS/HTML_Lists.html) `<ol>` and `<ul>`. I also learned how to make [HTML Tables](./Basic_HTML_and_CSS/HTML_Table.html) and how to style them with [CSS](./Basic_HTML_and_CSS/CSS/CSS_Table.css). That was just a few things i learned in this asignment as well as `text-shadow: ;`. 

## [Space Station](./Space_Station)

This project is an example of a Space station website. In this project i utilize a nave bar, links, and forms. in adittion to the html it is styled with CSS. This site uses several images as thumbnails that have a text overlay.

## [One Page Site](./One_Page_Website)

This project is very similar to the [Space Station](./Space_Station) but instead it is more geared towards pokemon and has some style changes.

## [Movie Theater](Movie_Theater_BS)

In this project I was tasked to utilize bootstrap to make a website. So I used bootstrap grid system to make a basic movie theater site, that includes Cards, Buttons and a nav bar.
